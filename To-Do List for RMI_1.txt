To-Do List for RMI_1
1) Change createFirstStep() and createSecondStep() to return the number applied to the question 
	number instead of the currentValue after its respective step (so createWrongAnswers() gets
	the data it needs)
Cop outs should change operatorTop and operatorBottom
2) Change setupLabels() to setup ALL GLabels (Not corresponding GPoints necessarily)

3) Thin ivars (do at end) (possible through another class?)
